# PeakTracker ðŸ“ˆ

PeakTracker is a plugin for [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/) that tracks the users peak (aka. highest achieved) MMR for all ranked gamemodes in Rocket League.

## Installation
 - Download and install [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/). 
 - **FINAL INSTALL DETAILS PENDING RELEASE**.

## Additional Information & Features
PeakTracker initially will set your peak to your current MMR for each gamemode (Values are pulled at the start and end of matches). As your MMR changes, your peak (highest obtained) MMR will be saved and only update once you've reached a higher MMR!

If your peak MMR is higher than your current MMR then you can manually set your peak through the in game menu!

### In-Game Menu

To get to this menu, while in-game press **F2** to open the BakkesMod Menu. Then select the **Plugins** tab, then finally select the **PeakTracker** plugin from the list that appears on the left.

All this information is saved in various text files in the following location: 
 - **%appdata%\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\PeakTracker**

### CSV Output

All peak information will be outputted in addition to the various text files a CSV file. The CSV file will contain more detailed information about the specific peak as shown in the screenshot above.

This will allow you to track your peak MMR progression over time or display the information anyway you want through something like Excel or a custom program! Let your imagination run wild! ðŸ¤¯

The CSV file is available in the following location:
 - **%appdata%\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\PeakTracker\PeakTracker.csv**

Instead of modifying this file directly it's reccommend that you make a copy that you then modify the copy. However, if you insist on modifying the original file make sure to leave the first line unmodified and always have an empty line at the end of the file otherwise there could be errors.

### OBS Intergration

If you use OBS and would like to add your peak MMR into your overlay you can create a **Text** source and select **Read from a file** and select the text file you want to display.

All text files are located in the following location: 
 - **%appdata%\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\PeakTracker**
